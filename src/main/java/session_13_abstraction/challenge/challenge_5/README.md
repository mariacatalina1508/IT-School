Create an abstract class 'Animal' with two abstract methods 'cats' and 'dogs'. Now create a class 'Cat' with a method 'cats' which prints "Cats meow" and a class 'Dog' with a method 'dogs' which prints "Dogs bark", both inheriting the class 'Animal'. Now create an object for each of the subclasses and call their respective methods.
